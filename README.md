Wakili Real Estate — Landing page

Files:
- `index.html` — main landing page
- `styles.css` — styles
- `scripts.js` — carousel script

How to use:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or serve with a static server).
2. The carousel auto-plays and can be controlled with the previous/next buttons or the dots.
3. Navigation links use smooth scrolling.

You can replace the Unsplash image URLs in `index.html` with your own images if you prefer local assets.

Note: This update adds simple scroll animations and lazy-loading for images to improve perceived performance; images are loaded on demand as they approach the viewport.

Low-quality image placeholders (LQIP) have been added: each image wrapper uses a small blurred preview that is replaced when the full image finishes loading.
